Description: This package contains function for an ensemble-based cell typing pipeline. 
            The method integrates multiple clustering and classification approaches 
            to improve cell type annotation accuracy in single-cell RNA-seq data. Additionally,
            The package also comprises functions to enable quality control and evaluation of 
            single-cells before and after cell-typing.
